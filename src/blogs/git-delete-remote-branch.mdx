## Deleting remote branches in Git

To delete a remote branch, we do not use the "git branch" command - but instead "git push" with the "--delete" flag:

```shell
$ git push origin --delete feature/login
```

## Deleting remote branches on Github

To delete a remote branch on github, first open your github repository

<div className="w-1/2">
    <Image

        alt="github repository"
        width={1897}
        height={1043}
        class="object-contain w-3/4"
    />
</div>

<p className="mt-5">then click on master branch and then view all branches</p>

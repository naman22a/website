            "description": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) play a crucial role in SAR image colorization, transforming grayscale SAR images into visually interpretable colorized representations. Since SAR images inherently lack natural color information, GANs learn complex mappings between SAR data and corresponding optical imagery, effectively generating realistic colorized outputs. The generator synthesizes colorized images, while the discriminator ensures realism by distinguishing between real and generated images. This approach enhances the interpretability of SAR data, aiding applications in terrain analysis, environmental monitoring, and disaster management by bridging the gap between SAR and optical imagery.",

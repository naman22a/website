It combines GAN-based SAR image colorization with CNN-based terrain classification to improve the interpretability and usability of remote sensing data. The project includes a React + Flask web interface, enabling users to upload grayscale SAR images and receive colorized, classified results in real-time. This powerful tool supports applications in agriculture, disaster response, and environmental monitoring by bridging the gap between SAR and optical imagery.",

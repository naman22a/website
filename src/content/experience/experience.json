            "descripiton": "During my internship at Airtel Payments Bank, I contributed to the Transparent Banking project by converting Figma UI designs into responsive, production-ready web pages. My work involved developing web interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, translating Figma designs into clean and maintainable front-end code, ensuring cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness, and collaborating with my mentor, Mr. Shubham, to refine UI components and enhance usability. This experience strengthened my skills in front-end development, UI implementation, and working within a structured, professional product environment."
